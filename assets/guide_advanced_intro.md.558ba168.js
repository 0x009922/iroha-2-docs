Here we will cover in some breadth the <em>Iroha special instructions</em>, Web-assembly, and how both are used in creating what&#39;s known as a <em>smart contract</em>.</p><p>The basic premise is; if the blockchain is the computer, then <code>iroha_client_cli</code> or any of the client libraries for that matter, are the keyboard, the blockchain is the hard drive, and the Iroha peer software is the processor. Like a processor, Iroha accepts portable instructions which modify what&#39;s written to the blockchain, allow certain users to use the network, and lock others out.</p><p>As such any operation that is run on-chain is written in terms of Iroha Special Instructions (ISI), and there is no other way of modifying the world state that would pass consensus. To understand why, we&#39;ll need to make a short detour into how Iroha is implemented under the hood.</p><p>Each interaction with the blockchain is done via a <em>transaction</em>. It&#39;s a collection of instructions, either glued together in sequence or called from a WASM blob (more on that later), that can register an account, remove an account, add X amount of Y currency etc. There are also queries, which return some values that you are allowed to access, which are also instructions. Each time you send a transaction to Iroha, it gets put into a queue, and when the time comes, the queue is emptied, and the consensus process begins. This process is a bit of mundane with a bit of black magic[^1]. The mundane aspect is that a special set of peers needs to take the transaction queue, and reproduce the same world state. If the world state cannot be reproduced for some reason or another, none of the transactions get committed to a block and consensus tries again. The reasoning behind this algorithm is simple: if someone had some evil peers and connected them to the existing network, if they tried to fake data, some good\u2122 peers would not get the same (evil\u2122) world state. If that&#39;s the case, the evil\u2122 peers would not be allowed to participate in consensus, and you would eventually produce a block using only good\u2122 peers. So if any changes to the world state are made without using ISI, they would not pass consensus and never get committed to a block.</p><h2 id="iroha-special-instructions" tabindex="-1">Iroha Special Instructions <a class="header-anchor" href="#iroha-special-instructions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>So what kinds of ISI do we have? If you&#39;ve read the tutorial on Rust or Python, you&#39;ve already seen a couple of instructions: <code>Register&lt;Account&gt;</code> and <code>Mint&lt;Quantity&gt;</code>. For the exhaustive list of Instructions you should probably consult our source code, however, here are some important classes.</p><h3 id="un-register" tabindex="-1">(Un)Register <a class="header-anchor" href="#un-register" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Instructions used to give an ID to a new entity on the blockchain. Everything that can be registered is <code>Identifiable</code>, but not everything that&#39;s <code>Identifiable</code> can be registered. As a rule, everything that can be registered, can also be un-registered, but that is not a hard and fast rule.</p><p>You can register a new account, a new asset definition, a peer, and a trigger (more on them later). Registering a peer is currently the only way of adding peers that were not part of the original <code>TRUSTED_PEERS</code> array to the network.</p><p>Registering an account is different. Iroha can be compiled in two modes: <em>public</em> and <em>private</em>. If it&#39;s compiled with <em>private</em> permissions, to register an account, you need an account. This is the default. If you want your users to be able to register without access to a pre-existing account, you need to compile Iroha in the <em>public</em> mode.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>As of writing, the set of public blockchain permissions is incomplete, and as such Iroha source code needs to be modified to run it in the <em>public</em> mode.</p></div><h3 id="mint-burn" tabindex="-1">Mint/Burn <a class="header-anchor" href="#mint-burn" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Can refer to assets, trigger uses (if the trigger has a limited number of repetitions), as well as temporary permission tokens. Some assets can be declared as non-mintable, meaning that any attempt to mint them post-registration will result in an error.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This will be changed in RC3.</p></div><p>Assets and permissions tokens need to be minted to a specific account, usually the one that registered the asset in the first place. All assets are assumed to be non-negative as well, so you can never have <code>-1.0</code> of <code>time</code> or <code>Burn</code> a negative amount and get a <code>Mint</code>.</p><h3 id="grant-revoke" tabindex="-1">Grant/Revoke <a class="header-anchor" href="#grant-revoke" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>These are used specifically for permissions. When minting a permission token, a user is granted <code>X</code> amount of permissions to do <code>Y</code> which will expire once all <code>X</code> operations were performed. By contrast, a <code>Grant</code> operation can be used to grant either a single permission, or a group of permissions (or a &quot;role&quot;), to a user permanently. As such these instructions should be used carefully.</p><h3 id="setkeyvalue-removekeyvalue" tabindex="-1">SetKeyValue/RemoveKeyValue <a class="header-anchor" href="#setkeyvalue-removekeyvalue" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>These instructions are used with the key/value store asset type. This use case has not received much attention so far, because storing data in the blockchain is rather advanced topic that we shall cover separately.</p><h3 id="query" tabindex="-1">Query <a class="header-anchor" href="#query" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>These are all the queries that can be made from the client side. This is not necessarily the only kind of information that is available on the network, but it&#39;s the only kind of information that is guaranteed to be accessible on all networks. Telemetry data is optional to the specific deployment of Iroha. Access to your account balance is required function.</p><h3 id="expressions-conditionals-logic" tabindex="-1">Expressions, Conditionals, Logic <a class="header-anchor" href="#expressions-conditionals-logic" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>All ISI operate on expressions. Each expression has an <code>EvaluatesTo</code> which is used in instruction execution. While you could specify the account name directly, you could also specify the account ID via some mathematical or string operation. You can check if an account is registered on the blockchain too.</p><p>Using expressions which implement <code>EvaluatesTo&lt;bool&gt;</code>, you can set up conditional logic and execute more sophisticated operations on-chain. For example, you can submit a <code>Mint</code> instruction only if a specific account is registered. Recall that you can combine this with queries, and as such can program the blockchain to do some amazing stuff. This stuff is what we refer to as <em>smart contracts</em>, and is the main defining feature of advanced usage of blockchain technology.</p><h2 id="triggers" tabindex="-1">Triggers <a class="header-anchor" href="#triggers" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The basic premise is that certain things can emit events: it could be a change of the state of some entity, e.g. an account, and/or a domain (you can&#39;t modify an account without changing the domain that it belongs to, but you can change the domain without touching any of its accounts), but it could also be the block being committed, some point in time being crossed, or even a direct signal emitted by executing a special ISI. All of these are events that triggers can be attached to.</p><p>A trigger is a fairly basic entity that can be registered. Just like with Accounts, you submit a <code>RegisterBox::Trigger</code>, which contains the necessary information. This information is a single account ID, which should ideally be a brand new account that you register in the same transaction (but for now it doesn&#39;t matter); an executable, which itself is either a <code>Vec&lt;Instruction&gt;</code> or a WASM blob; and an <code>EventFilter</code>, something which combs through (at this point all) events and returns <code>true</code> when it finds an event that you like to start the execution.</p><p>The documentation on the <code>EventFilter</code> types is under construction, as we are likely to make major changes to that particular architecture. For now, suffice it to say that you can look at the source code in <code>iroha_data_model</code> and see a few particularly interesting applications.</p>',29),s=[n];function r(c,h,d,l,u,p){return a(),t("div",null,s)}var f=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
