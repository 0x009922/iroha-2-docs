# Conclusions

The current iteration of the Iroha 2 tutorial is a constant work in progress. With every release added to Iroha2, there will be more functionalities added and better explained that will expand on the bases set within this document and delve deeper into the rabbit hole.

Once Iroha 2 is ready, this tutorial is due to receive an update that covers an overview on permissions, and the different types available; such as multi signature, custom permission validators and permission groups. Another major topic to be included will be peer management, covering adding or removing peers, and peer configuration without using docker compose. We hope you look forward to it.

It has been mentioned in the introduction to this document that any iterative changes and updates will be added to the tutorial and clearly outlined so that the reader can distinguish the changes and implementations.
